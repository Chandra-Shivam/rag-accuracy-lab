# Experiments

Every change is measured on the same golden set. One change per row.

## Day 1 predictions for v0 (written before any code)

Golden set: 50 questions (14 single_fact, 8 needs_table, 8 multi_part, 8 comparison, 12 unanswerable).
Failures will be labelled by stage: **ingestion** (text extraction), **retrieval** (gold page not in top-k)
or **generation** (wrong answer, or answered when it should have abstained).

Ranked from most failures to fewest:

1. **unanswerable**, generation. Top-k always returns the closest chunks, often lookalikes
   (e.g. employer penalties for q39). With no abstention rule, the model answers from them.
2. **needs_table**, ingestion. Flattened tables either keep the chunk out of the top-k or make
   the model read the wrong row (q15/q35 also need the rule on p15t p6 *and* the table on p7).
3. **multi_part**, generation and chunking. All 8 have one gold page; expect partial answers,
   or a chunk boundary splitting the two parts.
4. **comparison**, retrieval and generation. q35 and q36 need both gold pages in the top-k;
   q34 needs arithmetic.
5. **single_fact**, retrieval. Mostly right; risks are near-duplicate forms (W-4 / W-4P / W-4 sp)
   and q05, where training memory ($600) contradicts the document ($2,000).
